# Weather Dashboard

## Description
- I created this webpage to test my ability to call server-side APIs, as well as learn how to use a CSS framework.
- This program uses OpenWeatherMap's geocoding and 5-day forecast APIs, as well as jQuery and Bootstrap.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Upon loading the webpage, the user is presented with the option to search for a city or click the button in the top right corner to alternate between Metric and Imperial units. Once the user searches for a city, the current weather will appear in the large box on the right side of the page, and the 5-day forecast will appear underneath it. Below the search bar, the six most recent searches will be stored, and the user can click on any of them to bring up the weather forecast for that area.
